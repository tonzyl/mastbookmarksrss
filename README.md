# mastbookmarksrss
A little script that fetches Mastodon bookmarks through the API and transforms them into a RSS feed.

You need an Access Token that is set to (only) reading bookmarks, by going into your Mastodon developer menu option and create an application.

This php script can be placed on a website / hosting package you control. Then you can add yoururl/mastbookmarksrss.php to a feedreader of choice.

GitHUb Co-pilot was used in generating parts of this code, which were tweaked for my use case. Hence I place the resulting code in the public domain.
